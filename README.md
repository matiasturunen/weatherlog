# Weatherlog
Weather data logging utility for apartment environment monitoring. Includes Raspberry Pi app to monitor and save information to remote server. Server on the other hand is responsible for keeping hold of data and to create graphs from it. 

## How to use

1. Install Raspberry Pi code to the Pi with temp, hum and pres sensors (I'm planning to use SENSE HAT)
2. Install remote server software
3. Generate access token for the Pi and save it to the Pi. Connect Pi to the internet.
4. Cross your fingers and wait for first databurst =)
